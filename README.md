Hi, I am Pablo from Spain. I am an Industrial Engineer and I work as Project Manager in Supply Chain. 

Over the years I've realized that I enjoy a lot to analyze data. Hence, I want to expand my knowledge in Python and maybe one day to become a Data Scientist in the field of SC.

Interested in any challengue, contest or colaboration!
Really interested in start my own company.
